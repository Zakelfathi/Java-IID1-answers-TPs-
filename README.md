# Welcome to my repository for the OOP and JEE practical work of the 2021/2022 academic year, done in collaboration with my partner Lahmama Fatima-Zahraa.
#
This repository contains various projects and exercises that were developed as a part of our curriculum, using the Java programming language and technologies such as JEE.
#
The projects range from basic OOP concepts such as classes and interfaces, to more advanced topics such as web development and database integration.
#
We have used various tools such as Eclipse, Maven and Tomcat to design, develop and test our applications.
#
Feel free to browse the code and use it as a reference or inspiration for your own projects.
We would be happy to hear any feedback or suggestions you may have.
